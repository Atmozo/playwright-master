# 🎭 Learning Playwright

My personal practice repo to learn Playwright while keeping my Selenium/Maven setup running.

## Why This Repo Exists

I use Selenium with Maven. It works fine, but I keep hearing about Playwright and figured I should learn it. Not switching - just adding another tool to the belt.

## My Plan

**Week 1:** Level 1 basics  
**Week 2:** Level 2 intermediate  
**Week 3-4:** Level 3 advanced + build something real

No strict schedule. Just trying to get through it and actually learn this stuff.

If you're in the same boat (Selenium user, curious about Playwright), feel free to use this.
